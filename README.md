# 🌍 Metal Mind Monitor

**Real-time Monitoring and Analysis of Heavy Metal Pollution**  
_PS Code: 25067 | Team: Tech Champs (DAV University, Jalandhar)_  

---

## 🚀 Introduction
Industrial effluents and human activities are releasing heavy metals into rivers, lakes, and soil.  
Currently, **authorities lack a centralized, real-time tool** to monitor, analyze, and visualize this pollution effectively.  

**Metal Mind Monitor** solves this by providing:  
- A **web application** powered by AI to calculate the **Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI)**  
- **Interactive maps** showing safe/unsafe zones  
- **Dashboards & auto-reports** for quick, data-driven decision-making  

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
- **Scattered & Complex Data:** Pollution data exists in disconnected formats (lab reports, PDFs, Excel sheets).  
- **Lack of Actionable Insight:** Authorities see raw numbers, not meaningful risk scores.  
- **Disconnected Decisions:** No easy way to visualize hotspots and take timely action.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution
### 1. **Centralized Data Hub**
- Unifies all pollution data into one platform.  

### 2. **Automated Risk Scoring (HPI)**
- Converts raw heavy metal values into an easy-to-understand risk score.  

### 3. **Visual Intelligence & Reporting**
- Live map shows hotspots (safe vs unsafe).  
- Auto-generate PDF reports for quick decision-making.
